					Hello everyone my name is Tai and I am front end web developer I switched into this career 3 years ago and the technologies I mainly work in is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and currently I am software engineer at Nevo Technologies and I am here to talk about how I turned a hobby into the career I have today.

				<h3>For starters...I was like this girl...</h3>
				<img src="img/tim-gouw-79563.jpg">
				<aside class="notes">
					I started out like this girl..I was working in finance doing the same thing day in and day out and the only excitment I got was when something broke and I was able to troubleshoot it to fix it. Other than that I hated going to work but I needed to do it because it was paying the bills. It wasn‚Äôt anything I loved doing, it was just something I did. Has anyone else ever felt that???  For me, after work, I would escape my life by reading books and watching movies. I didnt know how to change my situation but I can at least enjoy the fantasy world after work. And one of the book series I fell in love with that would be the hobby and catalyst that completely changed my life, was Twilight.

					So now you may be thinking how on earth did I manage that and it boils down to fansites. My first ever fansite was on twilight.

				<aside class="notes">
					But before the fansite, it started with me being involved with a huge and I when I say huge it was like thousands of people in this twilight fandom on twitter. They introduce me to fansites and to blogging. Most importantly they got me sucked up into a whole new world I didn't even know existed. 
					
					I met people who taught me about how to blog, about blogging platforms such as wordpress. When I first started I didnt know the first thing to bringing a site to life. So when my first fansite was made, it was made by someone who made a business out of designing and building wordpress themes for fansites. And there are many women out there doing that as their main job or their side job and I thought that that was amazing and I wanted to do something like that for a living. 
					
					So when I finally got my first fansite up and running I needed to learn how to maintain it, so my nights after work became consumed with how to get my site to where I wanted it to be. And these amazing women introduced me to programs like photoshop and illustrator so I can learn how to make the graphics that I wanted to add to the site. Then they introduced me to programming languages like html and css and php. So that gave me even more things I needed to learn in order to do what I wanted to do on the site. 
					
					During the day at work when I had free time, it just became my way to keep reading up on everything I was trying to learn how to do with my new site. I became obsessed and I was excited about everything I was learning and doing. I really wanted to get better at it so that one day I could possibly be like those women who made a living designing fansites.

				<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/e0mEvthANj8ha" width="480" height="240" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
				<aside class="notes">
					So when I got laid off from my job, it became a blessing in disguise because one of those ladies I met in the twilight fandom convinced me that getting laid off was the best thing that could ever happen to me. So I took that as my sign to go back to school to learn how to become a web designer and actually get a job in the field. And that is exactly what I ended up doing. 
					
					I didnt know about the bootcamps at the time so I went back to school for another bachelors degree in web design. While in school it really helped me realize my passion was for coding and not really the design aspect. From there it just took on a life of its own and I knew that this was what I wanted, it was the something else and the something better that excited me. If it wasnt for Twilight, I can seriously say that I wouldn't be here right now telling you how my love of Twilight and those amazing women on twitter helped me make the switch into tech to become this badass developer.
