				<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>I started out like this girl..I was working in finance doing the same thing day in and day out and the only excitment I got was when something broke and I was able to troubleshoot it to fix it.</li>
							<li>Other than that I hated going to work but I needed to do it because it was paying the bills. It wasn‚Äôt anything I loved doing, it was just something I did. </li>
							<li> Has anyone else ever felt that???</li>
							<li>For me, after work, I would escape my life by reading books and watching movies. I didnt know how to change my situation but I can at least enjoy the fantasy world after work.</li>
							<li>And one of the books I fell in love with that would completely changed my life, was Twilight.</li>

					<p>So now you may be thinking how on earth did I manage that and it boils down to fansites. My first ever fansite was on twilight. </p>

				<aside class="notes">
				
					<p>But before the fansites  it started with me being involved with a huge and I when I say huge it was like thousands of people in this twilight fandom on twitter.</p>

					<p>They introduce me to fansites and to blogging. Most importantly they got me sucked up into a whole new world I didn't even know existed. </p>
					
					<p>I met people who taught me about how to blog, about blogging platforms such as wordpress. When I first started I didnt know the first thing to bringing a site to life.</p>
					
					<p> So when my first fansite was made, it was made by someone who made a business out of designing and building wordpress themes for fansites. And there are many women out there doing that as their main job or their side job and I thought that that was amazing and I wanted to do something like that for a living. </p>
					
					<p>So when I finally got my first fansite up and running I needed to learn how to maintain it, so my nights and weekends after work became consumed with how to get my site to where I wanted it to be. And these amazing women introduced me to programs like photoshop and illustrator so I can learn how to make the graphics that I wanted to add to the site. Then they introduced me to programming languages like html and css and php. So that gave me even more things I needed to learn in order to do what I wanted to do on the site. </p>
					
					<p>During the day at work when I had free time, it became my way to keep reading up on everything I was trying to learn how to do with my new site. I became obsessed and I was excited about everything I was learning and doing. I really wanted to get better at it so that one day I could possibly be like those women who made a living designing fansites. 	</p>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>In the meantime, as I got comfortable with working on my first site. I hired another woman who became on of my besties in the twilight fandom and she helped me add more fansites under my belt. </p>

				<h2>Now What?!?!</h2>
				<img src="img/bella.gif">
				<aside class="notes">
						<p>So when I got laid off from my job, it became a blessing in disguise because one of those ladies I met in the twilight fandom convinced me that getting laid off was the best thing that could ever happen to me. </p>
						<p>I took that as my sign to go back to school to learn how to become a web designer and actually get a job in the field. And that is exactly what I ended up doing. </p>
					
						<p>I didnt know about the bootcamps at the time so I went back to school for another bachelors degree in web design. While in school it really helped me realize my passion was for coding and not really the design aspect.</p>

				<h2>Work...</h2>
